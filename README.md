## Background
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

The goal is to be able to predict whether clients are capable of repayment and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.

## Intuition
For this project, I am choosing to use a deep learning model. The choice of a deep learning model for this project stems from its ability to effectively capture complex patterns within the data. The scalability of deep learning models enables them to leverage large datasets, while continuous advancements in the field offer the promise of improved performance over time. Henceforth, the decision to employ a deep learning approach aligns with the project's goal of efficiently handling diverse and complex data patterns.

## What I have learnt
Not every problem is a deep learning problem. Opting for traditional machine learning algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM over neural networks may be justified in scenarios where interpretability, training speed, and efficiency on smaller datasets are paramount. XGBoost and LightGBM offer transparent decision-making processes, making them more interpretable, and their ability to perform well with limited data is advantageous. The faster training speed of these algorithms, coupled with simpler hyperparameter tuning, can be crucial in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, the decision to choose XGBoost or LightGBM hinges on prioritizing interpretability, computational efficiency, and effective performance with smaller datasets.
